##NetApp Trident 
###Simplify the Consumption of Persistent Volumes (PV) in Kubernetes
Persistent storage for stateful applications is a major inhibitor in the broad adoption of containers for the enterprise. NetApp was the first to offer a robust and [fully supported](https://netapp-trident.readthedocs.io/) open-source solution to address this gap and has since increased its investment and participation in the community and its partner ecosystem to shape the way containers approach data management. 

Container technology is an essential piece of [NetApp’s Data Fabric](https://www.netapp.com/us/info/what-is-data-fabric.aspx) vision. Trident enables customers to get the most out of their NetApp investment, simplifying the deployment of containers throughout the enterprise while protecting and managing data, wherever, whenever — across the fabric. 

[Trident](https://github.com/netapp/trident) is a Container Storage Interface (CSI) compliant dynamic storage orchestrator that enables consumption and management of storage resources across all popular NetApp storage platforms. It natively integrates with Kubernetes to dynamically provision persistent volume requests on demand. Additionally, Trident has a REST interface that can be used by any application to create and manage storage across the configured resources.
